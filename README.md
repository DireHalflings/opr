# OPR - Riverside Version

The goal of this project is to improve the OPR Rulebook to the end of making it easier and clearer to play OPR. 

This will be accomplished first by improving the text of the Rulebook by: standardizing the language and terms used, clarifying rules interactions, and use of clear examples.

This will be accomplished secondly by removing, adding, or changing rules in cases where the improvments to play **significately** outway the downslides of custom rules.

Take a look at the updated [OPR Rulebook here.](https://github.com/joshuacords/opr/blob/master/OPR-Riverside-Version.md)

Also take a look at potential rules changes under [Experimental rules here](https://github.com/joshuacords/opr/blob/master/OPR-Experimental-Rules.md).
